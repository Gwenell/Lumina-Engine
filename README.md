# 🌟 Lumina Engine

Lumina Engine is an open-source, modular game engine and editor built with Bend (Bevy + Rust). It’s designed to empower developers with a powerful, flexible toolkit for creating high-performance games. Leveraging modern technologies and designed with extensibility in mind, Lumina Engine supports a variety of rendering techniques, making it suitable for both 2D and 3D game development.




## ✨ Features

#### 🌐 Multi-Rendering Support:

 -Ray Tracing: NVIDIA RTX, DirectX Raytracing (DXR) for realistic lighting and reflections.

 -Rasterization: Utilize Vulkan, OpenGL, or DirectX for traditional 3D rendering.

 -Voxel Rendering: Create detailed voxel-based worlds with PolyVox.

 -Sprite & Tile-Based Rendering: Ideal for 2D games using SDL2 and SFML.

 -Canvas Rendering: Use Cairo and Skia for 2D vector graphics.

#### ⚙️ Flexible Scripting:

-Block-Based Development: Design game logic visually with an intuitive block-based system similar to Unreal Engine’s Blueprints.
 
-Manual Scripting: Write custom scripts in Lua or Python for more control over game behavior.

#### 🔌 Extensible Architecture:

-Add or modify engine features with a robust extension system that allows you to tailor the engine to your specific needs.

#### 🚀 Cross-Platform Support:

-Develop and deploy games on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
