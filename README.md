# Lumina-Engine
Lumina Engine is an open-source, modular game engine and editor designed to provide developers with a powerful, flexible toolkit for creating high-performance games. Built on modern technologies and designed with extensibility in mind, Lumina Engine supports a variety of rendering techniques, making it suitable for both 2D and 3D game development.
Features

    Multi-Rendering Support:
        Ray Tracing: NVIDIA RTX, DirectX Raytracing (DXR) for realistic lighting and reflections.
        Rasterization: Utilize Vulkan, OpenGL, or DirectX for traditional 3D rendering.
        Voxel Rendering: Create detailed voxel-based worlds with PolyVox.
        Sprite and Tile-Based Rendering: Ideal for 2D games using SDL2 and SFML.
        Canvas Rendering: Use Cairo and Skia for 2D vector graphics.

    Flexible Scripting:
        Block-Based Development: Design game logic visually with an easy-to-use block-based system, similar to Unreal Engine’s Blueprints.
        Manual Scripting: Write custom scripts in Lua or Python for more control over game behavior.

    Extensible Architecture:
        Add or modify engine features with a robust extension system that allows you to tailor the engine to your specific needs.

    Cross-Platform Support:
        Develop and deploy games on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
